# yonder_media_test


###A repo on the test from laravel (Yonder Media)
==============================================


##I'd like to firstly thank you all, for the opportunity.:smile:


It's clear to me that I still have some learning to do with laravel,
the task I found a bit tricky and honestly I gave it my best shot :bullseye:

#What I could do
---------------

I managed to get integrated into the laravel environment. I also manged  to enusre
that I could connect to the db and also read and create entries (tinker).

I was about to finally read the files and their contents.

`http://localhost/tweets/create`

`http://localhost/users/create`

I also managed to display that content out and learned how to integrate the internal
bootstrap without actually having to use the CDNs.

I managed to use artisan quite a lot, it's very similar to cake bake, I must say.


#What I couldn't do 
-------------------

I was not able to actually pull the content do the string manipulation and 
ensure that I can move content form the file through a controller into the 
db and this was I'd say the crux of  the challenge.
 

#What I enjoyed to do
---------------------
Tinker made my life som much easier especially when seeding databases with 
random content. I'll continue using this tool despite what I walk away with.

Laravel is neat! It allows you to easily integrate db, ui and model behaviour
pretty well & in a very non-abstract way.


#What I didn't enjoy doing
-------------------------
The folder structure in laravel shows that the coders making it wanted to cover
as much s possible, this will need a good IDE, something like Intellij somtimes
I found my self lost between folders.

Once again thanks for the opportunity, I walk away a better programmer either way :)
